          Francisco Javier Luna Figueroa(04 de Marzo de 1998, ???), I was 7 years old when my dad gave me my first console a Gameboy. 
          Since that beautiful moment, I start my love with videogames. 
          I grew up to the age of 12 and my mom decided to change that gameboy to a Nintendo. 
          So the most part of my life I have been around of technology, but everything clicks when I had to decide which high school area fits me better. 
          I decided engineering and technology, also because I always had 9 or 10 in math classes. 
          When I started to go to the IT classes, I felt really amazed of all the things I could do just with a code file. 
        </p>
        <p class="my-life-text">
          After high school I entered to computer systems engineering in Technological Institute of Colima with a remote modality. 
          I had to choose remote/distance modality because my mom gave to me her job in government. It was pretty easy to had both, but I wanted to improve my self even more. 
          So I started to study with videos, documentation and bootcamps. 
          I learned mostly about frontend. At the moment I'm a full stack developer in a company called Balety. 
          I got this job after I finished my career, but I want to learn react and get a better job.
